## Quantitative Scoring Model

Each opportunity is evaluated across:

- Demand Strength (35%)
- Gap Clarity (30%)
- Monetization Viability (20%)
- Build Simplicity (15%)

Weighted formula:

(demand × 0.35) +
(gap × 0.30) +
(monetization × 0.20) +
(build × 0.15)

All scores must be justified with observed signals.

## Revenue Estimation Logic

If direct revenue data exists → use it.

Otherwise:

Freemium:
Estimated installs ≈ ratings × 100

Paid:
Estimated installs ≈ ratings × 40

Revenue estimate:
installs × 3% × subscription price

All proxy data labeled with confidence level.
